The rights of a prototype
• Should not be required to be complete
• Should be easy to change
• Gets to retire

Prototyping Overview
- Prototyping is a method for quickly creating design approximations to gather feedback.
- It facilitates conversations among stakeholders, including colleagues, clients, users, and designers.

Types of Prototypes
- Prototypes can vary in form and purpose, helping to **explore different design questions**.

Iterative Design Process
- Prototyping is an **iterative** process where **multiple alternatives** are explored based on **feedback**.
- Early prototypes should be **incomplete** and **easily changeable** to encourage **rapid learning and adaptation**.

Prototyping in Various Contexts
- Prototyping is applicable to both small and large projects, such as software and aircraft design.
- The goal is to ask the **right questions** and **gather valuable insights** throughout the design process.

Questions about Evaluate Designs with People
- Can people figure out how to use it? 
- Or do they swear or giggle when using this interface? 
- How does this design compare to that design? 
- And if we change the user interface, how does that change people's behavior?

1. Usability studies: As designers we get blinders to systems' quirks, bugs, and false assumptions. 
	1. In the real world, people have different tasks, goals, motivations, and physical settings.
	2. Please-thee experimenter bias: 
	3. No comparison point.
	4. Get feedback from people is to use a survey, lots and quick. There is difference between what people say and what they're gonna do.
	5. Focus group.
	6. Feedback from experts: peer critique, dogfooding, heuristic evaluation
	7. Participant observation and comparative experiments: is a good way of gaining insights by discovering people’s actual practices, as opposed to self-report

We might assume that the ordering of search results may play an important role in what people click on

Issues to Consider
• Reliability/Precision
• Generalizability
• Realism
•Comparison
•Work Involved


Understanding the Value of User Evaluation
- Evaluating designs with users provides insights that can lead to new ideas, necessary changes, and bug fixes.
- It helps to understand user behavior and preferences, which can be complex and subjective.

Common Methods for User Evaluation
- Usability Studies: Observing users in a controlled environment to identify issues, though this may lack ecological validity.
- Surveys: Collecting feedback from a larger audience, but responses may not always reflect actual behavior.
- Focus Groups: Gathering a small group to discuss designs, which can yield diverse insights but may also lead to biased responses.

Advanced Evaluation Techniques

- Expert Feedback: Utilizing structured formats like Heuristic Evaluation to gain insights from experienced individuals.
- Comparative Experiments: Testing multiple design options to determine effectiveness and user experience.
- Participant Observation: Observing users in their natural environment for long-term insights into their interactions with designs.
