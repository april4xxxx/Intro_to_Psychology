Understanding Language

- Language is a central aspect of human cognition and is essential for explaining theories about the mind.
- Various disciplines, including philosophy and psychology, contribute to understanding language, making it a critical area of study.

Defining Language

- The lecture emphasizes a specific definition of language, referring to systems like English, Dutch, and Mandarin, rather than broader forms of communication.
- Clarity in terminology is important for scientific discussions about language learning and brain encoding.

Recommended Readings

- Two books are recommended: "The Language Instinct" by Steven Pinker, which introduces the science of language, and "The Power of Babel" by John McWhorter, which explores the historical evolution of language.

**Language Universality**

- All human societies possess language, indicating that it is a universal trait among humans.
- Unlike other human skills, such as baking or writing, language is **instinctive** and **natural**, as suggested by Charles Darwin.

**Creolization and Language Development**

- Creolization occurs when children exposed to a pidgin language transform it into a fully developed language, known as a creole.
- This phenomenon highlights the innate ability of children to create complex language systems from rudimentary communication.

**Cognitive Aspects of Language**

- Language is characterized by creativity, allowing for the generation of an infinite number of sentences.
- Understanding language involves abstract, unconscious rules that enable comprehension and production of new sentences, rather than mere memorization.

Understanding Morphology

- Morphology studies the structure and formation of words, emphasizing the arbitrary nature of language as described by Ferdinand de Saussure.
- The relationship between sounds (like "dog") and their meanings is arbitrary, allowing languages to refer to an infinite number of concepts.

Morphemes vs. Words

- A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning, while words can be formed by combining morphemes.
- Understanding morphemes helps in deciphering new words; for example, knowing "dog" and the plural morpheme "-s" allows one to understand "dogs."

Language Productivity

- Some languages, like German or Hebrew, exhibit more productivity in word formation through morphology compared to English.
- The ability to create and understand new words reflects a significant cognitive capacity in humans.

Vocabulary Knowledge

- Estimating the number of words or morphemes an average English speaker knows is complex, but estimates suggest around 8,000 words for a high school graduate.
- This vocabulary acquisition occurs rapidly, with individuals learning about 10 new words daily from ages one to seventeen.
