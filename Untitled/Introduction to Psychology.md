## Development
Morality and Its Origins

- Discusses two contrasting views on morality: one suggesting we are born immoral (Hobbes, Freud) and another proposing we are inherently good (Rousseau).
- Highlights the impact of culture on moral development, including issues like prejudice and racism.

Continuity Between Children and Adults

- Examines the relationship between childhood behavior and adult personality, suggesting early traits can predict later outcomes.
- Mentions studies indicating that interviews with young children can forecast their future behaviors and relationships.

Cognitive Development Perspectives

- Introduces three views on cognitive development: empiricism (learning from experience), nativism (innate structures), and constructivism (a blend of both).
- Emphasizes that learning is complex and involves interaction with the environment, rather than just accumulating information.

### Development Psychologists: Jean Piaget
Understanding Jean Piaget

- Piaget is recognized as the founder of modern developmental psychology, emphasizing the development of knowledge in humans.
- He viewed children as active thinkers, likening them to "little scientists" who construct understanding through experiences.

Key Concepts: Schemas, Assimilation, and Accommodation

- Schemas are mental frameworks that help individuals acquire knowledge.
- Assimilation involves **integrating new information into existing schemas**, while accommodation refers to **modifying schemas to incorporate new experiences**.

Stages of Cognitive Development

- Piaget proposed that children's thinking evolves through distinct stages, each characterized by different reasoning styles.
- His approach contrasts with other theories, as he believed children's theories of the world differ significantly from adults' understanding.
### Four stage
Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years)

- Infants learn through sensory experiences and motor activities, lacking reasoning and understanding of object permanence.
- Object permanence is achieved when children realize that objects continue to exist even when out of sight.

Preoperational Stage (2-7 years)

- Children begin to reason and understand object permanence but are egocentric, unable to see perspectives other than their own.
- They also struggle with the concept of conservation, believing that quantity changes with the arrangement of objects.

Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years)

- Children develop logical thinking and overcome egocentrism, but still have difficulty with abstract reasoning.
- They can perform operations mentally but may not yet understand scientific reasoning or hypothetical situations.

Formal Operational Stage (11 years and up)

- Individuals reach full cognitive maturity, capable of abstract and hypothetical reasoning.
- Piaget believed that everyone progresses through these stages naturally, without the influence of external pressures.
