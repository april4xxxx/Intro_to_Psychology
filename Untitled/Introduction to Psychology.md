Continuity Between Children and Adults

### Development Psychologists: Jean Piaget
Understanding Jean Piaget

- Piaget is recognized as the founder of modern developmental psychology, emphasizing the development of knowledge in humans.
- He viewed children as active thinkers, likening them to "little scientists" who construct understanding through experiences.

Key Concepts: Schemas, Assimilation, and Accommodation

- Schemas are mental frameworks that help individuals acquire knowledge.
- Assimilation involves **integrating new information into existing schemas**, while accommodation refers to **modifying schemas to incorporate new experiences**.

Stages of Cognitive Development

- Piaget proposed that children's thinking evolves through distinct stages, each characterized by different reasoning styles.
- His approach contrasts with other theories, as he believed children's theories of the world differ significantly from adults' understanding.
