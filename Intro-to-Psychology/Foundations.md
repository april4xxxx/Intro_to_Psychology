- Understand Descartes’ concept of dualism 二元论, identify the strengths of this view, and then explain why modern scientists have abandoned it
	- I think therefore I am.
- Understand the different parts and functions of a neuron![[Pasted image 20250705144440.png]]
	- Axon 轴突
	- Myelin sheath 髓鞘
	- Dentrite 树突
- Know the different types of neurons and their specific
- Understand how neurons communicate with one another
	- Gap between axon terminal and dentrite is synapse 突触![[Pasted image 20250705144820.png]]
- Know about the different subcortical structures and what they do
	- Spine 脊髓
	- In the center
	- Medulla 髓质 autonomic functions: heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing, etc.
	- Cerebellum 小脑 complicated skilled motor movements, mental and sensory tasks, automation of tasks
	- Hypothalamus 下丘脑 hunger, thirst, sleep, body temperature, regulation of homeostatic functions
- Know the different lobes of the cerebral cortex and their functions![[Pasted image 20250705145828.png]]
	- Occipital lobe: vision
	- Temporal lobe: sound
	- The size of the brain areas correspond to which there's motor or sensory functions. ![[Pasted image 20250705150010.png]]
- Understand and distinguish different problems than can arise from brain damage, including apraxia 失用症, agnosia 认不出，心盲, sensory neglect 感觉不到外界, aphasia 失语症, acquired psychopathy 丧失道德或者控制自己的能力
- Understand the concept of lateralization and contralateral organization
	- Two parts communication through corpus callosum 胼胝体
- Distinguish the functions of the right hemisphere from the left hemisphere
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705151326.png]]Sensory information is sent to opposite hemisphere crossing over in pathways leading to cortex
	- Motor crossover: right hemisphere controls left side, left hemisphere controls right side
	- Visual crossover: left eye to right hemisphere, right eye to left hemisphere
